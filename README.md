## My process

- Mark up the HTML
- Add flexbox where needed
- Add CSS from top to bottom
- If I can't figure out exactly how to do something, don't get too caught up on it and come back later.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

- You can match the border radius of an image inside a parent element by adding `overflow: hidden` on the parent element.
- Backgrounds can take both a color and an image at the same time.

### Continued development

I hope to become faster at marking up HTML and planning out which CSS properties to use. I can get the design to look similar to the original, but it takes me a long time to get there as I have to think about what properties to use and where.
